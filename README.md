This repository contains game API implementations that will be supported natively by Katan containing extra functionality and that will be available in the development API.
Games do not need to be here to be supported by Katan since to create a new game it is only necessary to create a new game file in the Katan games root directory.

## Supported games
*There is no supported game so far.*

## Contributing
We thank you for all the contribution made by the community to this repository, to contribute with a new game you can make a Pull Request for this repository with your game data, use the other games as an example for development.

It is important that the file `my -game.conf` is present in your game's resource folder.
Remember that this repository is only a **API** of Katan games, for the definition of game declarations that need extra functionality within Katan, go to the server module and make a contribution, there, in relation to your game.
